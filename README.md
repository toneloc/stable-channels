## Stable Channels

Stable Channels is a wallet and technology that lets users peg a portion of their bitcoin to a dollar balance. 

### Downloads
- [macOS (.dmg)](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/app-mac.dmg)
- [Windows (.exe)](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/app-win.exe)
- [Linux (.AppImage)](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/app-linux.AppImage)

The Stable Channels Desktop Wallet runs a full Lightning node that lets users stabilize the money that they send to themselves during onboarding. 

The LSP/Server keeps the user stable by overcollateralizing the Stable Channel at the time of channel creation. Each user (the stability receiver and the the LSP/stability provider) puts in the same amount of bitcoin, the stability mechanism is activated. 

The stability mechanism works like this: each node queries four exchange price feeds every minute. Based on the updated price, they adjust the channel balance with their counterparty to keep the stability receiver's balance at a fixed dollar value (e.g., $100,000 of bitcoin).

Both parties remain self-custodial and can opt out anytime via cooperative or forced on-chain channel closure. 

The project is in-progress and is based on LDK Node. Prior versions were compatible with LND and CLN. These legacy implementation can be found in /legacy.

### Run the User Desktop Wallet 

You can check out the latest builds for MacOS, Windows, or Linux here - https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels/releases

### Run from Source

To run the app from this source, please install Rust on your OS.

Using a fresh Ubuntu? You may need to install OpenSSL libraries. `sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev` and `curl`.

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels` and `cd` into it.

Run `cargo run --bin stable-channels user`. This will start the app on mainnet. Pay the invoice and you are good to go.

Check out logs, key files, and other information in `/data`.

### Stable Channels Process

Every 30 seconds, the price of bitcoin:

- **(a) Goes up:**
  - **Stable Receiver loses bitcoin.**
    - Less bitcoin is needed to maintain the dollar value.
    - The Stable Receiver pays the Stable Provider.
  
- **(b) Goes down:**
  - **Stable Receiver gains bitcoin.**
    - More bitcoin is needed to maintain the dollar value.
    - The Stable Provider pays the Stable Receiver.
  
- **(c) Stays the same:**
  - **No action required.**

*Note: Stable Channels are currently non-routing channels. Work is ongoing to add routing and payment capabilities.*

## Payout Examples (entry = $100,000/BTC)

Each side puts in 1 BTC at $100,0000.

Abbreviations:
- SR = Stable Receiver (targeting $100,000)
- SP = Stable Provider
- Δ = Delta / Change
