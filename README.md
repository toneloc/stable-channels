[![main on CLN v24.02.2](https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels/actions/workflows/main_v24.02.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels/actions/workflows/main_v24.02.yml)

## Stable Channels

Stable Channels is a wallet and technology that lets users peg a portion of their bitcoin to a dollar balance. 

The Stable Channels Desktop Wallet runs a full Lightning node on either MacOS, Linux, or Windows, and lets users stabilize the money that they send to themselves. 

The LSP/Server keeps the user stable by overcollateralizing the Stable Channel at the time of channel creation, whereupon each user puts in the same amount of bitcoin, the stability mechanism is activated. 

The stability mechanism works like this: each node queries four exchange price feeds every minute. Based on the updated price, they adjust the channel balance with their counterparty to keep the stability receiver's balance at a fixed dollar value (e.g., $100,000 of bitcoin).

Both parties remain self-custodial and can opt out anytime via cooperative or forced on-chain channel closure. 

The project is in-progress and is based on LDK Node. Prior versions were compatible with LND and CLN. These legacy implementation can be found in /legacy.

### Run the User Desktop App on MacOS, Windows, or Linux

You can check out the latest builds here - t

To run the app from this source, please install Rust on your OS.

Using a fresh Ubuntu? You may need to install OpenSSL libraries. `sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev` and `curl`.

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels` and `cd` into the directory in **two windows**.

#### Steps:

1. **Start up the app.**

   - In one window, run:

     ```bash
     cargo run --features user
     ```

   - In the other window, run:

     ```bash
     cargo run --features lsp
     ```

2. **Get some test BTC**

   - In the **user window**, run:

     ```bash
     getaddress
     ```

   - Go to [Mutinynet Faucet](https://faucet.mutinynet.com/) and send some test sats to the address you obtained.

   - In the **user window**, run:

     ```bash
     balance
     ```

     Wait until your BTC shows up there. For testing, we'll go ahead and use this to fund both sides of the channel.

3. **Open the Stable Channel**

   - Open a channel by running in the user window:

     ```bash
     openchannel [NODE_ID] [LISTENING_ADDRESS] [SATS_AMOUNT]
     openchannel 02a4b5670f4c756e8dd541a4966e1f68183eafacdb14e2e58d03f4d47b8ca72222 127.0.0.1:9737 320000
     ```

   - Then, run:

     ```bash
     listallchannels
     ```

     Check if `"channel_ready"` equals `"true"`. This will take 6 confirmations or a minute or two.

4. **Start the Stable Channel for Both Users**

   | Window           | Command                                                                                                                          | Example Command                                                                                                                                        |
   |------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **User Window**  | `startstablechannel CHANNEL_ID IS_STABLE_RECEIVER EXPECTED_DOLLAR_AMOUNT EXPECTED_BTC_AMOUNT`                                | ` startstablechannel cca0a... true 100.0 0`                                                                                                        |
   | **LSP Window**   | `startstablechannel CHANNEL_ID IS_STABLE_RECEIVER EXPECTED_DOLLAR_AMOUNT EXPECTED_BTC_AMOUNT`                                | ` startstablechannel cca0a... false 100.0 0`                                                                                                       |

   - This command means:

     > Make the channel with ID `cca0a...` a stable channel with a value of $100.0 and 0 native bitcoin, where it is `true` (or `false`) that I am the stable receiver.

### Stable Channels Process

Every 1 minute, the price of bitcoin:

- **(a) Goes up:**
  - **Stable Receiver loses bitcoin.**
    - Less bitcoin is needed to maintain the dollar value.
    - The Stable Receiver pays the Stable Provider.
  
- **(b) Goes down:**
  - **Stable Receiver gains bitcoin.**
    - More bitcoin is needed to maintain the dollar value.
    - The Stable Provider pays the Stable Receiver.
  
- **(c) Stays the same:**
  - **No action required.**

*Note: Stable Channels are currently non-routing channels. Work is ongoing to add routing and payment capabilities.*

## Getting Started with LND and CLN

- **Supported Implementations:**
  - **CLN Plugin:** `stablechannels.py`
  - **Standalone LND App:** `lnd.py`

For CLN, clone this repo, or create a `stablechannels.py` file with the contents of `stablechannels.py` for CLN. 

### Connecting and creating a dual-funded channel (for CLN)

If your Lightning Node is running, you will need to stop your Lightning Node and restart it with the proper commands for dual-funded (or interactive) channels.

You can do this with the following commands.

Stop Lightning: `lightning-cli stop` or `lightning-cli --testnet stop`.

Next, start your CLN node, or modify your config files, to enable dual-funding channels up to the amount you want to stabilize, or leverage. This will look like this

```bash
lightningd --daemon --log-file=/home/ubuntu/cln.log --lightning-dir=/home/ubuntu/lightning --experimental-dual-fund --funder-policy=match --funder-policy-mod=100 --funder-min-their-funding=200000 --funder-per-channel-max=300000 --funder-fuzz-percent=0 --lease-fee-base-sat=2sat --lease-fee-basis=50 --experimental-offers --funder-lease-requests-only=false
```
The "funder" flags instruct CLN on how to handle dual-funded channels. Basically this command is saying: "This node is willing to fund a dual-funded channel up to **300000** sats, a minimum of **200000** sats, plus some other things not relevant for Stable Channels.  

Your counterparty will need to run a similar command. 

Next connect to your counterparty running the CLN `connect` command. This will look something like: `lightning-cli connect 021051a25e9798698f9baad3e7c815da9d9cc98221a0f63385eb1339bfc637ca81 54.314.42.1`

Now you are ready to dual-fund. This command will look something like `lightning-cli fundchannel 021051a25e9798698f9baad3e7c815da9d9cc98221a0f63385eb1339bfc637ca81 0.0025btc`

If all goes well, we should be returned a txid for the dual-funded channel, and  both parties should have contributed 0.0025btc to the channel. 

Now this needs to be confirmed on the blockchain. 

### Starting Stable Channels

We need to start the Stable Channels plugin with the relevant details of the Stable Channel.

The plugin startup command will look something like this for CLN:

```bash
lightning-cli plugin subcommand=start plugin=/home/clightning/stablechannels.py channel-id=b37a51423e67a1f6733a78bb654535b2b81c427435600b0756bb65e21bdd411a stable-dollar-amount=95 is-stable-receiver=True counterparty=026b9c2a005b182ff5b2a7002a03d6ea9d005d18ed2eb3113852d679b3ec3832c2 native-btc-amount=0
```

Modify the directory for your plugin.

What this command says is: "Start the plugin at this directory. Make the Lightning channel with channel ID b37a51423e67a1f6733a78bb654535b2b81c427435600b0756bb65e21bdd411a a stable channel at $95.00. and 0 sats of BTC. Is is `True` that the node running this command is the Stable Receiver. Here's the ID of the counterparty `026b9c..`."

Your counterparty will need to run a similar command, and the Stable Channels software should do the rest. 

The startup command for the LND plugin will be something like this:

```bash
python3 lnd.py 
    --tls-cert-path=/Users/alice/tls.cert
    --expected-dollar-amount=100 
    --channel-id=137344322632000 
    --is-stable-receiver=false 
    --counterparty=020c66e37461e9f9802e80c16cc0d97151c6da361df450dbca276478dc7d0c271e 
    --macaroon-path=/Users/alice/admin.macaroon 
    --native-amount-sat=0 
    --lnd-server-url=https://127.0.0.1:8082
```

Stable Channel balance results for the Stable Receiver are written to the `stablelog1.json` file  and logs for the Stable Provider are written to the `stablelog2.json` file. 

##  Payout matrix

Assume that we enter into a stable agreement at a price of $60,000 per bitcoin. Each side puts in 1 bitcoin, for a total channel capacity of 2 bitcoin, and a starting USD nominal value of $120,000 total. The below table represents the payouts and percentage change if the bitcoin price increases or decreases by 10%, 20%, or 30%. Check out this payout matrix to better understand the mechanics of the trade agreement.
